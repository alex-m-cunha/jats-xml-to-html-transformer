                     of the academic community. We examine the origins and development of open access (OA)
                     publishing, highlighting how its implementation by for-profit publishers has led to
                     unintended consequences that do not serve researchers, academic institutions, policy
                     makers, and society generally. As a solution, we advocate for diamond OA journals,
                     which are free for readers and authors, ensuring immediate, paywall-free access to
                     content while allowing authors to publish without fees.</p>

            <h5 class="label">1.</h5>
            <p id="d5e89">We have established <i>Reviews of Economic Literature</i> (REL), a peer-reviewed, diamond open access (OA) journal, to advance the integrity
               of scholarly research and publication. REL is a collaboration with Stanford University
               Press (SUP) and the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) at Simon Fraser University and
               Stanford University. It is the first journal published under this joint initiative,
               and the first journal published by SUP since its founding in 1892. Diamond OA journals
               are free for readers and authors, and their content is immediately available on publication,
               without a paywall. Authors from anywhere in the world can publish in the journal free
               of charge.</p>
            <p id="d5e94">REL is an academic, not-for-profit collaboration among its editors because we believe
               that commercial publishing is becoming increasingly incompatible with scholarly research
               for inquiry and knowledge. As economists, we are all too aware that the primary motivation
               of commercial publishers, as with businesses generally, is profit maximization. The
               academic community makes bona fide contributions to scholarly publishing not to maximize
               publishers’ profits, but because publishing research is vital to the discovery and
               dissemination of quality scientific research that benefits the state of knowledge
               and humankind. In our view, some commercial publishers’ policies and practices are
               leading to perverse incentives that undermine editors’ independence, peer review,
               and the integrity of academic publishing. Business models that prioritize quantity
               over quality, as publishers chase revenue, for example, heighten the risk of spreading
               poor-quality science. Moreover, we consider unacceptable editor agreements that shift
               risks from publishers to editors and expose editors to unlimited liability for work
               that is ultimately pro bono.</p>
            <p id="d5e95">In this article, we describe the business model and governance structure we established
               at REL to help achieve fee-free, equitable OA to quality, usable, and sustainable
               research publications. We first motivate that discussion with an overview of OA, tracing
               its origins as a principle of unrestricted access to digital scholarly knowledge before

               have arisen in the context of measuring and ranking academic outputs and research
               productivity. We then explain how REL seeks to uphold the integrity of scholarly research

               <h5 class="label">2.1</h5>
               <p id="d5e102">The economic case for OA is compelling because knowledge generates positive externalities
                  and is nonrival in its use. The social benefits of knowledge far exceed private ones—that
                  is, the benefits of knowledge to society are greater than the benefits to the creator
                  of the knowledge. This article, however, is not about the production of new knowledge
                  but about funding the costs of publishing, disseminating, and archiving research so
                  that it is available to all in perpetuity.</p>
               <p id="d5e103">The BOAI released a statement in 2002 that is widely seen as the beginning of the
                  OA movement. The statement argues that OA is possible because of “the willingness
                  of scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly journals
                  without payment, for the sake of inquiry and knowledge” and because digital publication
                  costs are much lower than for “traditional forms of dissemination” (<a href="#b2">BOAI, 2002</a>).</p>
               <p id="d5e108">OA publication received a significant boost when public and private research funders
                  embraced the concept by requiring the dissemination of research findings in OA journals
                  or repository platforms. Wellcome Trust, a global charitable foundation to “support
                  discovery research into life, health and wellbeing” (<a target="xrefwindow" href="https://wellcome.org" id="d5e110">https://wellcome.org</a>) was the first major funder to introduce such a requirement in 2005. Other agencies
                  followed, with Plan S representing a major group of funders pursuing OA in 2018. <a href="#b14">Plan S (n.d.)</a> requires research sponsored by national and European research councils and funding
                  bodies be “published in Open Access Journals, on Open Access Platforms, or made immediately
                  available through Open Access Repositories.”</p>

            <div class="section"><a id="S4"><!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">Adoption of OA by commercial publishers</h3>
               <h5 class="label">2.2</h5>
               <p id="d5e119">The academic publishing industry, which is dominated by a handful of for-profit companies
                  that control a large portion of scholarly publishing (<a href="#b4">Butler et al., 2023</a>), has come to endorse OA, we believe, for pragmatic reasons. To remain outlets for
                  publicly sponsored publication, publishers had to make this work freely accessible
                  in compliance with funder mandates. Publishers were also concerned that journal subscription
                  revenues would decline with tightening tertiary-sector library budgets and as libraries
                  were moving to support OA in response to funding cuts and the new opportunities offered
                  with digital sharing. Different commercial OA publishing models, which could maintain
                  revenues, started to emerge with different publishers using their own definitions
                  of OA, which often deviate from the original <a href="#b2">BOAI (2002)</a> definition. The more common commercial OA publishing models, which preserve revenues
                  for companies, are green, gold, and hybrid.</p>
               <p id="d5e127">Green OA is also known as self-archiving. Publishers allow authors of journal articles
                  to post earlier versions of their manuscripts up to the final draft in repositories
                  and online, typically after an embargo period, while the published version appears
                  in the journal, which is sold through a subscription.</p>
               <p id="d5e128">Gold OA articles are published in OA or hybrid journals. Published articles are permanently
                  and freely available online for anyone to read. Gold OA articles involve article processing
                  charges (APCs), which is a fee charged post-acceptance of a journal article and paid
                  by authors, authors’ grants, their institutions, or some other source. Gold OA articles
                  are normally covered by some version of a Creative Commons license that grants permission
                  to distribute the work freely under copyright law. The author typically retains copyright,
                  the publisher obtains the right to publish, and the choice of license dictates what
                  others can do with the published article.</p>
               <p id="d5e129">Hybrid journals, finally, are subscription journals that charge APCs to allow articles
                  to be OA while the remainder of the journal content sits behind a paywall (journal
                  subscription or pay-per-article). Hybrid journals differ from gold OA journals (which
                  publish only gold OA articles) because readers still must pay a subscription to access
                  the non-OA portion of the journal’s content. Hybrid OA can lead to “double dipping”—that
                  is, charging for publishing the same article twice, once for subscription and once
                  for OA (<a href="#b1">Asai, 2023</a>), although publishers take steps to avoid this.</p>

               <h5 class="label">2.3</h5>
               <p id="d5e137">Lower costs for digital publication than traditional forms of dissemination and economies
                  of scale should have led to reduced APCs, but they have not. APCs are typically high
                  and unsustainable for most individuals (see <a href="#S13">Appendix</a>). <a href="#b4">Butler et al. (2023)</a> estimated that authors globally paid $1.06 billion in publication fees to the top
                  five publishing companies between 2015 and 2018, while <a href="#b19">Zhang et al. (2022)</a> estimated the global revenues of 12 major OA publishers from APCs exceeded $2 billion
                  in 2022.</p>
               <p id="d5e148">Following pressure from researchers, various funding mechanisms and models have evolved
                  to cover APCs.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> It is now common practice for publishers to negotiate contracts with libraries, university
                  administrations, or national consortia, offering bundled access to subscription-based
                  and hybrid journals, along with agreements to cover the APCs of the articles published
                  by faculty members of subscribing institutions. These are known as “transformative”
                  agreements because the traditional subscription-based publishing model is financing
                  the move toward an OA one. However well-intentioned they might be, given the oligopolistic
                  market structure of academic publishing, a consequence of these initiatives is that
                  they support commercial publishers’ revenues and shareholder profits.</p>
               <p id="d5e154">Commercial publishers are able to charge APCs above the costs incurred for publishing
                  and disseminating new knowledge because they have acquired top-tier journal titles
                  that authors and their employers regard as prestigious and reputation-enhancing (e.g.,
                  with an Impact Factor from Web of Science) for their institution, and that play an
                  important role in deciding tenure, promotion, and academic faculty remuneration (<a href="#b8">Garfinkel et al., 2024</a>; <a href="#b9">Gibson et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#b10">Gomez-Mejia &amp; Balkin, 1992</a>; <a href="#b18">Swidler &amp; Goldreyer, 1998</a>). Publishers thus have been able to position themselves as gatekeepers of authors’
                  career advancement and universities’ academic recognition. Combined with national
                  research evaluation exercises—where academic performance is often financially incentivized—and
                  the requirements imposed by private and publicly funded grant agencies discussed above,
                  these changes have provided commercial publishers with significant bargaining power
                  in their negotiations with libraries and university administrators.</p>
               <p id="d5e168">Digital publishing, the rise in research output since the 1990s, and performance targets
                  (e.g., growth in submissions or published articles), which risk compromising quality
                  control, have contributed to significant article growth, placing greater demands on
                  the unpaid work of editors and referees. Pressures to publish have also led to an
                  increase in unethical behaviors, such as breaches of scientific standards and plagiarism
                  (see, e.g., <a href="#b11">Köbli et al., 2024</a>; <a href="#b12">Mathew et al., 2022</a>) and to predatory publishing, which is reinforced by the above-normal profits earned
                  by commercial publishers. Predatory journals “are publications that claim to be legitimate
                  scholarly journals but misrepresent their publishing practices” (<a href="#b7">Elmore &amp; Weston, 2020</a>, p. 607). They publish articles for a fee without providing robust editorial services
                  and peer review.</p>

            <div class="section"><a id="S6"><!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">Diamond OA</h3>
               <h5 class="label">2.4</h5>
               <p id="d5e182">Diamond OA journals publish articles that are immediately available upon publication,
                  free for readers to access, and without APCs and submission fees for authors. The
                  diamond OA model differs from gold OA because it provides equitable OA to research
                  and publication. But it faces challenges.</p>
               <p id="d5e183">Commercial publishers own the rights to many journal titles. Their primary objective
                  is shareholder profit maximization, and they are unlikely to flip high-profit-margin
                  journals to diamond OA, which has less revenue-generating capacity than the APC model.
                  In March 2025, for example, 193, or 1.4 percent, of the 13,716 journals without fees
                  in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) were published by Elsevier, Sage,
                  Springer, SpringerOpen, and Taylor &amp; Francis. To achieve diamond OA and equitable
                  access to research and publication, a different approach to revenue generation needs
                  to be taken.</p>
               <p id="d5e184">For new diamond OA journals to become credible alternatives to well-established existing
                  journals requires (1) a strong reputation among peers to attract editors, authors,
                  and reviewers, and (2) securing the resources needed to manage the workflow of submissions
                  through the editorial process, the copyediting of accepted manuscripts, and the publishing,
                  hosting, and distributing of the journal’s content. While some costs have declined
                  to nearly zero (e.g., journal management software is available for free), others,
                  particularly labor-intensive roles such as the journal manager, have remained largely
                  constant.</p>
               <p id="d5e185">Despite these challenges, the diamond OA model is slowly being adopted. The DOAJ,
                  as of March 2025, listed 21,440 indexed journals, of which 64 percent (13,716) were
                  without fees. Editorial teams are resigning from corporate-owned journals (see <a href="#b17">Retraction Watch, n.d.</a>) and starting new diamond OA journals, and different diamond OA platforms and publishers
                  have entered the academic publishing market (<a href="#b6">Dudley, 2021</a>). For example, MIT Press publishes a full range of OA journals, including gold, hybrid,
                  and diamond OA journals, and the Open Library of Humanities (OLH), as of March 2025,
                  had 33 journals with no author fees in its portfolio. <a href="#b13">OLH (n.d.)</a> was “launched as an international movement of scholars, librarians, programmers,
                  and publishers in 2013.” The cofounders “wanted to rebuild an unfair system in which
                  corporate publishers make huge profits from publicly funded research by selling it
                  back to universities in subscription packages.” OLH is funded by more than 345 libraries
                  worldwide. Originally founded as a limited liability company, it became a registered
                  charity and now is part of Birkbeck, University of London.</p>
               <p id="d5e196">The costs of running diamond OA publications are covered by contributions from universities,
                  libraries, national funding agencies, government agencies, philanthropic sources,
                  and learned societies. Other diamond OA models include the Subscribe to Open (S2O)
                  approach. “Under the S2O model, subscribers are offered continued access to their
                  subscribed titles through the standard renewal process. When enough subscriptions
                  are renewed, the journal is moved to OA for that year” (<a href="#b5">De Gruyter Brill, n.d.</a>). The journal may revert to paywalled content, however, if funding falls short.</p>
               <p id="d5e201">Not-for-profit publishers lower entry costs for new journals by developing and offering
                  free and open-source software publishing platforms, whose source code is available
                  for modification and distribution. The Public Knowledge Project (PKP), discussed below,
                  offers such an infrastructure. Many universities offer, through their library or university
                  press, digital space to host journals, and sometimes also support the distribution
                  of content and discovery pathways to maximize visibility and impact of scholarly publications.</p>

                  in scientific publishing and (2) provide advice on the strategic direction of the
                  journal. Strategic matters include, but are not limited to, best practices in the
                  management of journals, transparency and integrity in scholarly research and publication,

            <h5 class="label">4.</h5>
            <p id="d5e246">REL has been established to help maintain integrity in scholarly research and publication.
               The landscape of academic publishing has been shaped by a handful of for-profit companies
               that control most of scholarly publishing. Well-intentioned actions and reactions
               by public and private funders have created an environment for excessive profit-seeking
               through charging readers, authors, or both. Furthermore, the reliance of research
               performance assessments based on publications in established journals controlled by
               commercial publishers has created unintended consequences, including author/article
               charges above the costs incurred for publishing and disseminating new knowledge. We
               have founded REL in response to such a landscape and from the experiences we have
               gained as editors within the current commercially driven system.</p>
            <p id="d5e247">REL is a peer-reviewed, diamond OA journal without fees for authors and readers. It
               is owned by a not-for-profit, limited liability company with charitable purposes.
               REL has a single mandate, which is to appraise and disseminate research on developments
               in the economic literature, free to access for anyone, anywhere, now and in the future.
               REL is published by an academic-led, nonprofit OA journal publishing initiative employing
               the S2O model of library support and an open-source publishing platform.</p>
            <p id="d5e248">New publishing organizations and infrastructure are emerging within the academy. Commercial
               publishing, we believe, is not a sustainable long-term option—it appears increasingly
               incompatible with, and unnecessary for, scholarly research for inquiry and knowledge.
               The diamond OA model is a credible alternative to commercially owned academic journals
               and, as editorial teams resign from corporate-owned journals, more diamond OA journals
               and initiatives funding them are bound to emerge.</p>
            <p id="d5e249">The demise of commercial academic publishing and the rise of diamond OA strike us
               as inevitable.</p>
