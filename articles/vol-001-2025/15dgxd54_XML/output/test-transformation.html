               <p>We envision <em>Reviews of Economic Literature</em> as part of a movement to restore scholarly publishing to the priorities and values
                  of the academic community. We examine the origins and development of open access (OA)
                  publishing, highlighting how its implementation by for-profit publishers has led to
                  unintended consequences that do not serve researchers, academic institutions, policy
                  makers, and society generally. As a solution, we advocate for diamond OA journals,
                  which are free for readers and authors, ensuring immediate, paywall-free access to
                  content while allowing authors to publish without fees.</p>

               <h2><span class="sec-label" aria-hidden="true">1.</span><span class="sec-title">Introduction</span></h2>
               
               
               
               <p>We have established <em>Reviews of Economic Literature</em> (REL), a peer-reviewed, diamond open access (OA) journal, to advance the integrity
                  of scholarly research and publication. REL is a collaboration with Stanford University
                  Press (SUP) and the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) at Simon Fraser University and
                  Stanford University. It is the first journal published under this joint initiative,
                  and the first journal published by SUP since its founding in 1892. Diamond OA journals
                  are free for readers and authors, and their content is immediately available on publication,
                  without a paywall. Authors from anywhere in the world can publish in the journal free
                  of charge.</p>
               
               <p>REL is an academic, not-for-profit collaboration among its editors because we believe
                  that commercial publishing is becoming increasingly incompatible with scholarly research
                  for inquiry and knowledge. As economists, we are all too aware that the primary motivation
                  of commercial publishers, as with businesses generally, is profit maximization. The
                  academic community makes bona fide contributions to scholarly publishing not to maximize
                  publishers’ profits, but because publishing research is vital to the discovery and
                  dissemination of quality scientific research that benefits the state of knowledge
                  and humankind. In our view, some commercial publishers’ policies and practices are
                  leading to perverse incentives that undermine editors’ independence, peer review,
                  and the integrity of academic publishing. Business models that prioritize quantity
                  over quality, as publishers chase revenue, for example, heighten the risk of spreading
                  poor-quality science. Moreover, we consider unacceptable editor agreements that shift
                  risks from publishers to editors and expose editors to unlimited liability for work
                  that is ultimately pro bono.</p>
               
               <p>In this article, we describe the business model and governance structure we established
                  at REL to help achieve fee-free, equitable OA to quality, usable, and sustainable
                  research publications. We first motivate that discussion with an overview of OA, tracing
                  its origins as a principle of unrestricted access to digital scholarly knowledge before
                  exploring the commercial fee-based variations of OA and how unintended consequences
                  have arisen in the context of measuring and ranking academic outputs and research
                  productivity. We then explain how REL seeks to uphold the integrity of scholarly research
                  and publication by following the recommendations of the Budapest Open Access Initiative
                  (BOAI) for the future of OA.</p>

                  <p>The economic case for OA is compelling because knowledge generates positive externalities
                     and is nonrival in its use. The social benefits of knowledge far exceed private ones—that
                     is, the benefits of knowledge to society are greater than the benefits to the creator
                     of the knowledge. This article, however, is not about the production of new knowledge
                     but about funding the costs of publishing, disseminating, and archiving research so
                     that it is available to all in perpetuity.</p>
                  
                  <p>The BOAI released a statement in 2002 that is widely seen as the beginning of the
                     OA movement. The statement argues that OA is possible because of “the willingness
                     of scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly journals
                     without payment, for the sake of inquiry and knowledge” and because digital publication
                     costs are much lower than for “traditional forms of dissemination” (<a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b2" aria-label="Reference BOAI, 2002">[BOAI, 2002]</a>).</p>
                  
                  <p>OA publication received a significant boost when public and private research funders
                     embraced the concept by requiring the dissemination of research findings in OA journals
                     or repository platforms. Wellcome Trust, a global charitable foundation to “support
                     discovery research into life, health and wellbeing” (<a href="https://wellcome.org">https://wellcome.org</a>) was the first major funder to introduce such a requirement in 2005. Other agencies
                     followed, with Plan S representing a major group of funders pursuing OA in 2018. <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b14" aria-label="Reference Plan S (n.d.)">[Plan S (n.d.)]</a> requires research sponsored by national and European research councils and funding
                     bodies be “published in Open Access Journals, on Open Access Platforms, or made immediately
                     available through Open Access Repositories.”</p>

                  <p>The academic publishing industry, which is dominated by a handful of for-profit companies
                     that control a large portion of scholarly publishing (<a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b4" aria-label="Reference Butler et al., 2023">[Butler et al., 2023]</a>), has come to endorse OA, we believe, for pragmatic reasons. To remain outlets for
                     publicly sponsored publication, publishers had to make this work freely accessible
                     in compliance with funder mandates. Publishers were also concerned that journal subscription
                     revenues would decline with tightening tertiary-sector library budgets and as libraries
                     were moving to support OA in response to funding cuts and the new opportunities offered
                     with digital sharing. Different commercial OA publishing models, which could maintain
                     revenues, started to emerge with different publishers using their own definitions
                     of OA, which often deviate from the original <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b2" aria-label="Reference BOAI (2002)">[BOAI (2002)]</a> definition. The more common commercial OA publishing models, which preserve revenues
                     for companies, are green, gold, and hybrid.</p>
                  
                  <p>Green OA is also known as self-archiving. Publishers allow authors of journal articles
                     to post earlier versions of their manuscripts up to the final draft in repositories
                     and online, typically after an embargo period, while the published version appears
                     in the journal, which is sold through a subscription.</p>
                  
                  <p>Gold OA articles are published in OA or hybrid journals. Published articles are permanently
                     and freely available online for anyone to read. Gold OA articles involve article processing
                     charges (APCs), which is a fee charged post-acceptance of a journal article and paid
                     by authors, authors’ grants, their institutions, or some other source. Gold OA articles
                     are normally covered by some version of a Creative Commons license that grants permission
                     to distribute the work freely under copyright law. The author typically retains copyright,
                     the publisher obtains the right to publish, and the choice of license dictates what
                     others can do with the published article.</p>
                  
                  <p>Hybrid journals, finally, are subscription journals that charge APCs to allow articles
                     to be OA while the remainder of the journal content sits behind a paywall (journal
                     subscription or pay-per-article). Hybrid journals differ from gold OA journals (which
                     publish only gold OA articles) because readers still must pay a subscription to access
                     the non-OA portion of the journal’s content. Hybrid OA can lead to “double dipping”—that
                     is, charging for publishing the same article twice, once for subscription and once
                     for OA (<a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b1" aria-label="Reference Asai, 2023">[Asai, 2023]</a>), although publishers take steps to avoid this.</p>

                  <p>Lower costs for digital publication than traditional forms of dissemination and economies
                     of scale should have led to reduced APCs, but they have not. APCs are typically high
                     and unsustainable for most individuals (see <a href="#S13">Appendix</a>). <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b4" aria-label="Reference Butler et al. (2023)">[Butler et al. (2023)]</a> estimated that authors globally paid $1.06 billion in publication fees to the top
                     five publishing companies between 2015 and 2018, while <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b19" aria-label="Reference Zhang et al. (2022)">[Zhang et al. (2022)]</a> estimated the global revenues of 12 major OA publishers from APCs exceeded $2 billion
                     in 2022.</p>
                  
                  <p>Following pressure from researchers, various funding mechanisms and models have evolved
                     to cover APCs.<sup><sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn1" data-fn-popup="fn1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></sup> It is now common practice for publishers to negotiate contracts with libraries, university
                     administrations, or national consortia, offering bundled access to subscription-based
                     and hybrid journals, along with agreements to cover the APCs of the articles published
                     by faculty members of subscribing institutions. These are known as “transformative”
                     agreements because the traditional subscription-based publishing model is financing
                     the move toward an OA one. However well-intentioned they might be, given the oligopolistic
                     market structure of academic publishing, a consequence of these initiatives is that
                     they support commercial publishers’ revenues and shareholder profits.</p>
                  
                  <p>Commercial publishers are able to charge APCs above the costs incurred for publishing
                     and disseminating new knowledge because they have acquired top-tier journal titles
                     that authors and their employers regard as prestigious and reputation-enhancing (e.g.,
                     with an Impact Factor from Web of Science) for their institution, and that play an
                     important role in deciding tenure, promotion, and academic faculty remuneration (<a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b8" aria-label="Reference Garfinkel et al., 2024">[Garfinkel et al., 2024]</a>; <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b9" aria-label="Reference Gibson et al., 2017">[Gibson et al., 2017]</a>; <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b10" aria-label="Reference Gomez-Mejia &amp; Balkin, 1992">[Gomez-Mejia &amp; Balkin, 1992]</a>; <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b18" aria-label="Reference Swidler &amp; Goldreyer, 1998">[Swidler &amp; Goldreyer, 1998]</a>). Publishers thus have been able to position themselves as gatekeepers of authors’
                     career advancement and universities’ academic recognition. Combined with national
                     research evaluation exercises—where academic performance is often financially incentivized—and
                     the requirements imposed by private and publicly funded grant agencies discussed above,
                     these changes have provided commercial publishers with significant bargaining power
                     in their negotiations with libraries and university administrators.</p>
                  
                  <p>Digital publishing, the rise in research output since the 1990s, and performance targets
                     (e.g., growth in submissions or published articles), which risk compromising quality
                     control, have contributed to significant article growth, placing greater demands on
                     the unpaid work of editors and referees. Pressures to publish have also led to an
                     increase in unethical behaviors, such as breaches of scientific standards and plagiarism
                     (see, e.g., <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b11" aria-label="Reference Köbli et al., 2024">[Köbli et al., 2024]</a>; <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b12" aria-label="Reference Mathew et al., 2022">[Mathew et al., 2022]</a>) and to predatory publishing, which is reinforced by the above-normal profits earned
                     by commercial publishers. Predatory journals “are publications that claim to be legitimate
                     scholarly journals but misrepresent their publishing practices” (<a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b7" aria-label="Reference Elmore &amp; Weston, 2020">[Elmore &amp; Weston, 2020]</a>, p. 607). They publish articles for a fee without providing robust editorial services
                     and peer review.</p>

                  <h3><span class="sec-label" aria-hidden="true">2.4</span><span class="sec-title">Diamond OA</span></h3>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Diamond OA journals publish articles that are immediately available upon publication,
                     free for readers to access, and without APCs and submission fees for authors. The
                     diamond OA model differs from gold OA because it provides equitable OA to research
                     and publication. But it faces challenges.</p>
                  
                  <p>Commercial publishers own the rights to many journal titles. Their primary objective
                     is shareholder profit maximization, and they are unlikely to flip high-profit-margin
                     journals to diamond OA, which has less revenue-generating capacity than the APC model.
                     In March 2025, for example, 193, or 1.4 percent, of the 13,716 journals without fees
                     in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) were published by Elsevier, Sage,
                     Springer, SpringerOpen, and Taylor &amp; Francis. To achieve diamond OA and equitable
                     access to research and publication, a different approach to revenue generation needs
                     to be taken.</p>
                  
                  <p>For new diamond OA journals to become credible alternatives to well-established existing
                     journals requires (1) a strong reputation among peers to attract editors, authors,
                     and reviewers, and (2) securing the resources needed to manage the workflow of submissions
                     through the editorial process, the copyediting of accepted manuscripts, and the publishing,
                     hosting, and distributing of the journal’s content. While some costs have declined
                     to nearly zero (e.g., journal management software is available for free), others,
                     particularly labor-intensive roles such as the journal manager, have remained largely
                     constant.</p>
                  
                  <p>Despite these challenges, the diamond OA model is slowly being adopted. The DOAJ,
                     as of March 2025, listed 21,440 indexed journals, of which 64 percent (13,716) were
                     without fees. Editorial teams are resigning from corporate-owned journals (see <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b17" aria-label="Reference Retraction Watch, n.d.">[Retraction Watch, n.d.]</a>) and starting new diamond OA journals, and different diamond OA platforms and publishers
                     have entered the academic publishing market (<a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b6" aria-label="Reference Dudley, 2021">[Dudley, 2021]</a>). For example, MIT Press publishes a full range of OA journals, including gold, hybrid,
                     and diamond OA journals, and the Open Library of Humanities (OLH), as of March 2025,
                     had 33 journals with no author fees in its portfolio. <a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b13" aria-label="Reference OLH (n.d.)">[OLH (n.d.)]</a> was “launched as an international movement of scholars, librarians, programmers,
                     and publishers in 2013.” The cofounders “wanted to rebuild an unfair system in which
                     corporate publishers make huge profits from publicly funded research by selling it
                     back to universities in subscription packages.” OLH is funded by more than 345 libraries
                     worldwide. Originally founded as a limited liability company, it became a registered
                     charity and now is part of Birkbeck, University of London.</p>
                  
                  <p>The costs of running diamond OA publications are covered by contributions from universities,
                     libraries, national funding agencies, government agencies, philanthropic sources,
                     and learned societies. Other diamond OA models include the Subscribe to Open (S2O)
                     approach. “Under the S2O model, subscribers are offered continued access to their
                     subscribed titles through the standard renewal process. When enough subscriptions
                     are renewed, the journal is moved to OA for that year” (<a class="cite" role="doc-biblioref" href="#b5" aria-label="Reference De Gruyter Brill, n.d.">[De Gruyter Brill, n.d.]</a>). The journal may revert to paywalled content, however, if funding falls short.</p>
                  
                  <p>Not-for-profit publishers lower entry costs for new journals by developing and offering
                     free and open-source software publishing platforms, whose source code is available
                     for modification and distribution. The Public Knowledge Project (PKP), discussed below,
                     offers such an infrastructure. Many universities offer, through their library or university
                     press, digital space to host journals, and sometimes also support the distribution
                     of content and discovery pathways to maximize visibility and impact of scholarly publications.</p>

                  SUP and PKP. It is the first journal that SUP has published in its 133-year history,
                  as Stanford seeks to support making research more widely and publicly available on
                  an equitable basis for authors and readers. PKP is a nonprofit research initiative

                  that never exclude authors on economic grounds; and (4) academic or nonprofit control

                     used by more than 52,000 journals worldwide, which is developed, supported, and freely

                     services as the best commercial journals at no cost to authors and readers. These
                     services include a team of editors with prior experience managing and editing prestigious
                     journals, an experienced and dedicated journal manager to oversee editorial coordination
                     and submission processing, an easy-to-use journal management system, and robust support
                     for copyediting, production, and proofreading, through our publisher SUP.</p>
                  
                  <p>The costs of delivering these services are estimated to be less than half the current
                     average APCs of commercial academic publishers’ hybrid journals. This cost efficiency
                     is achieved through a noncommercial focus, saving on unnecessary managerial expenses,
                     the pro bono contributions of the editorial team and advisory board, the use of free
                     and open-source software, and the publisher’s ability to minimize expenses by operating
                     solely online. REL has a hybrid funding model that includes grants from governments
                     and foundations committed to promoting new diamond AO journals and S2O library fees.</p>

                     to access for anyone, anywhere, now and in the future. The company constitution stipulates
                     that the company must be maintained exclusively for charitable purposes and this requirement
                     cannot be changed. REL cannot be operated for private profit, and it cannot be sold
                     or given to a for-profit commercial publisher or entity.</p>
                  
                  <p>The journal editors are the company’s shareholders and appoint the directors of the
                     company.<sup><sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn2" data-fn-popup="fn2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></sup> The directors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the charitable purposes
                     of the company and must act in its best interest. They appoint coeditors in chief
                     and managing editors, who appoint associate editors, and advisory board members. All
                     appointments are nonremunerable positions for 5-year renewable terms. The coeditors
                     in chief and managing editors also appoint the journal manager, who is paid an honorarium
                     and manages the submission workflow, supports the editors, and assists authors and
                     reviewers. Having professional, efficient, and effective journal management, we believe,
                     is essential to support authors, peer reviewers, and editors in their contributions
                     to scholarly publishing, which they make without payment.</p>
                  
                  <p>The advisory board, whose members are industry experts, is a key part of the REL governance

                     in scientific publishing and (2) provide advice on the strategic direction of the
                     journal. Strategic matters include, but are not limited to, best practices in the
                     management of journals, transparency and integrity in scholarly research and publication,

               <p>REL has been established to help maintain integrity in scholarly research and publication.
                  The landscape of academic publishing has been shaped by a handful of for-profit companies
                  that control most of scholarly publishing. Well-intentioned actions and reactions
                  by public and private funders have created an environment for excessive profit-seeking
                  through charging readers, authors, or both. Furthermore, the reliance of research
                  performance assessments based on publications in established journals controlled by
                  commercial publishers has created unintended consequences, including author/article
                  charges above the costs incurred for publishing and disseminating new knowledge. We
                  have founded REL in response to such a landscape and from the experiences we have
                  gained as editors within the current commercially driven system.</p>
               
               <p>REL is a peer-reviewed, diamond OA journal without fees for authors and readers. It
                  is owned by a not-for-profit, limited liability company with charitable purposes.
                  REL has a single mandate, which is to appraise and disseminate research on developments
                  in the economic literature, free to access for anyone, anywhere, now and in the future.
                  REL is published by an academic-led, nonprofit OA journal publishing initiative employing
                  the S2O model of library support and an open-source publishing platform.</p>
               
               <p>New publishing organizations and infrastructure are emerging within the academy. Commercial
                  publishing, we believe, is not a sustainable long-term option—it appears increasingly
                  incompatible with, and unnecessary for, scholarly research for inquiry and knowledge.
                  The diamond OA model is a credible alternative to commercially owned academic journals
                  and, as editorial teams resign from corporate-owned journals, more diamond OA journals
                  and initiatives funding them are bound to emerge.</p>
               
               <p>The demise of commercial academic publishing and the rise of diamond OA strike us
                  as inevitable.</p>
