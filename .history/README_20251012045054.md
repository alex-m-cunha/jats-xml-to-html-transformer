# JATS → HTML Transformer (Editor Package)

## Quick start
- Unzip the provided ZIP (versioned).
- Double‑click `run.command`.
- Select the XML at: `…/articles/<volume>/<article>/input/<articleId>.xml`.
- Output is created at: `…/articles/<volume>/<article>/output/` (index.html + assets).

## Input structure
```
<article>/
  input/
    <articleId>.xml
    pdf/
      <articleId>_PDF.pdf  (optional)
  article-img/
    <images referenced by XML>
  output/  (generated)
```

## Conventions
- PDF name: `<articleId>_PDF.pdf`.
- Images: use the filenames referenced in the JATS `<graphic xlink:href="…">`.
- One folder per article.

## Upload to OJS
- Zip the `output/` folder.
- Upload as HTML galley. OJS will register and rewrite asset URLs.

## Troubleshooting
- macOS blocked script: right‑click `run.command` → Open → Open.
- Missing PDF link: ensure the file is named `<articleId>_PDF.pdf` under `input/pdf/`.
- Missing images: ensure files sit in `article-img/` and are referenced by name in XML.
